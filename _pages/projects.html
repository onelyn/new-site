        The human auditory cortex is distinguished by enormous variation in the patterns of cortical folding seen across individuals. 
        An objective characterization of structural variation in human auditory cortex is important because variation in auditory cortical morphology has been associated with phonological processing (Eckert, 2024), 
        auditory expertise (Golestani et al., 2011), language disorders (Leonard et al., 2001), and language lateralization (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2014). 
        In this study, we used an unsupervised data-driven clustering approach to characterize folding patterns of the superior temporal plane (including HG and PT) based on a large sample (n=1065) 
        of brain scans from the Human Connectome Project.

        Anatomical asymmetry is a hallmark of the human brain and may reflect hemispheric differences in its functional organization. 
        In this study, we demonstrate systematic biases in cortical surface area lateralization measured from the default processing pipeline of FreeSurfer. 
        Notably, these biases occur prominently in key speech and language regions. 
        We found that these biases result from discrepancies in how regional labels are defined in the left vs. right hemisphere in the default cortical parcellation atlases. 
        We further demonstrate several straightforward, bias-free approaches to measuring surface area asymmetry.
