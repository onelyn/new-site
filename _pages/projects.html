        Anatomical asymmetry is a hallmark of the human brain and may reflect hemispheric differences in its functional organization. 
        In this study, we demonstrate systematic biases in cortical surface area lateralization measured from the default processing pipeline of FreeSurfer. 
        Notably, these biases occur prominently in key speech and language regions. 
        We found that these biases result from discrepancies in how regional labels are defined in the left vs. right hemisphere in the default cortical parcellation atlases. 
        We further demonstrate several straightforward, bias-free approaches to measuring surface area asymmetry.
