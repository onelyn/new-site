Hi! I'm Yinuo Liu. I'm a second-year PhD student working with [Dr. Tyler Perrachione](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/profile/tyler-k-perrachione-ph-d/) at Boston University. I'm interested in the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying human language processing in both typical and atypical brains. Major approaches I'm using right now include fMRI, behavioral experiments, and computational modeling.
